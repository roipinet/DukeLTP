  <p>This is what I would honestly call a <em>palomera</em> movie. This is a term we use in Mexico to describe a movie that will never ever win an Oscar, nor stands out in any paticular subject except its entertainment value. I personally really enjoy it, and it is a testament to the fact that with Tom Cruise you can never go wrong. Now, for you literature fans, I must say <b>this movie has little to do with H.G. Well's <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_of_the_Worlds" target="blank_">War of the Worlds</a></em>.</b> In fact, I could say with some confidence that it is also about aliens that come out of the ground and travel in tripod-shaped ships, but that is as far as it goes with respect to source material adaptation. The film actually takes place in the early XXI century in the USA, not in XX century UK. Nevertheless, it is a great way to spend a saturday afternoon. </p>

  <p>This <em>Amazon Original Series</em> is more like an <em>Amazon <b>More-or-less</b> Original Series</em> as it is based on Philip K. Dick's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle">novel of the same name.</a> Now, I'm honestly still watching this, but so far it has been quite the ride to see what could have been the "normal" in the world, had the Axis won WWII and taken over the "free world". It really makes you thin"k on a neverending succession of "<em>what-if's</em> just like this one. A very interesting view on what we consider nowadays to be an unthinkable scenario.</p>

  <p>Otherwise known as <b>Come on! IT'S BEEN 9 YEARS SINCE BOOK 2!!</b>, <em>The Kingkiller Chronicle </em> tells the story of an orphan child destined to be the savior of the world (after attending college, of course) that discovers he is akin to magic. Don't get me wrong, this is by no means a Harry Potter ripoff, and Patrick Rothfuss has a unique storytelling style, he is just a little slow to polish the final details of book 3, like continental drift slow. In any case, this story told as adult Kvothe's (orphan child) recalling of his past life to a passing historian is absolutely amazing.</p>
